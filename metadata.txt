description=Designed as a processing algorithm provider. Manage linear networks and compute multimodal routing and accessibility. Several functionalities as generating a graph from a linear layer, invert and split polylines, and connect point to a linear objects, and perform a linear-based deterministic interpolation for accessibility maps and build isochrones polygons.Computes multimodal routing and accessibility. Include a dataset for testing,a Musliw documentation and an algorithm for detecting non connected nodes

about=Networks algorithm provider. Manage linear networks. Several functionalities as generating a graph from a linear layer, reverting and splitting polylines, connecting points to a linear objects, performing a linear-based deterministic interpolation for accessibility maps and generating isochrons polygons. The purpose of the plguin is also to deal with the multimodal calculator tool Musliw (manage input ou output files). Compute multimodal routing and accessibility with extern Musliw tool provided, which can be called by the Musliw computation algorithm in QGis
