# Optional items:

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog entries:
changelog=1.2.9 create graph bug fix
	1.2.8 move bug tracker on github
	1.2.7 fix bug in interpolation
	1.2.6 Isobands generation in memory (less minidump?)
	1.2.5 fix bug in interpolation introduced in 1.2.4
	1.2.4 fix some bugs interpolation with multilinestrings and add fields from interpolation without remove old ones
	1.2.3 changes in isoband generation (reduction of the number of minidumps)
	1.2.2 fix bugs if isoband generation with complex polygons
	1.2.1 fix some bugs
	1.2 generation of isobands with spatialite (because pb with combine API in QGis 2.10)

	1.1 add a functionnality to generate isobands (polygons objets)
	1.0.1 some bug fixes in line-based interpolation
	1.0 add a fonctionnality linear-based interpolation for accessibility maps taking into account one way/two way links, side of spread and impassibility
